1Java1 annotations can be be used at build-time, when you build your software project. The build process includes
generating source code, compiling the source, generating XML files (e.g. deployment descriptors), packaging the
compiled code and files5 into a JAR file etc. Building the software is typically done by an automatic build tool
like Apache Ant or Apache Maven. Build tools5656 may scan your6b Java codeg7 for specific annotations and generate source
code or other files based on these annotations.
